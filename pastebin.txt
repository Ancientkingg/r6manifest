I'm going to show you how to download the leaked Rainbow Six Siege TS build with year 5 season 3 and 4.
Currently its being hoarded by a couple of losers so we are gonna share it with the community.
They are desperate for attention so expect some really shitty videos covered in ugly ass watermarks.
Luckily for you I'm giving you the keys to their autism. 
Fuck donald trump btw :)
 
You will need a STEAM account with Rainbow Six Siege. If you don't have one wait for someone to upload this leak or fuck off.
  
Once the game is downloaded you will need to put the PLAZA files located in your folder in the game files.
If it prompts you to replace files, replace them
then replace your test server files with the leaked files. 
When that is done delete rainbowsix_be.exe, make a copy of rainbowsix.exe and rename it to rainbowsix_be.exe.
 
launch the game and open cheat engine.
attach to rainbowsix_be.exe in cheat engine.
add this address as a byte "[RainbowSix_BE.exe+4CA8B10]+70C" without the quotes
set the byte to zero and you should be able to bypass the start screen.
 
Enjoy playing the early season 3 and 4!
if you are too dummy to follow this then just download all the shit here. you still need to add your steam username to the batch file download_Y5S3-4_Leak.bat
